    <h1>01 Hello UNIX</h1>

    <p>The Unix console, also known as the terminal or shell, is a command-line interface that allows users to interact
        with the Unix operating system or Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS through text commands.
    </p>

    <p>In this tutorial, we will simulate having the UNIX console, but we will write the commands in the lower section.
        To execute the code, press the <strong>ENTER</strong> key.</p>

    <h2>üìù Instructions:</h2>
    <p>Print the path of the current working directory with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
