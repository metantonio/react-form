    <h1>03 Navigate Between Directories</h1>

    <p>To move between directories, we can use the <strong>cd</strong> (current directory) command and then provide the path to where we want to go.</p>
    
    <p>The path can be absolute (specifying the complete address)</p>
    <code>cd C:/users/documents/images/</code>
    
    <p>It can also be relative. Suppose we are currently in the 'documents' directory and want to go to the 'images' directory.</p>
    <code>cd ./images</code>
    
    <p>Now that we are in the 'images' directory, let's say we want to go back 1 level to return to the 'documents' directory.</p>
    <code>cd ../</code>
    
    <h2>üìù Instructions:</h2>
    <p>Check the directory you are in and the folders around it. Navigate using relative paths to the <strong>unix</strong> folder.</p>
